### Aider Configuration

- Use the `.aider.conf.yml` file in the workspace for persistent settings
- Leverage the `read:` directive to automatically load CONVENTIONS.md
- Set `auto-commits: false` to maintain manual control over commits
- Use `subtree-only: true` to work within git repository subdirectories
