This page is intended to summarize Jira issue **DEMO-4**:

## Status

The Jira issue content is not accessible from the current documentation update environment, so this page cannot include an accurate summary of the issue at this time.

- A pasted JSON payload from `GET /rest/api/2/issue/DEMO-4` (sanitized as needed).
- A pasted copy of the issue fields in plain text (summary, description, steps, acceptance criteria).

Once available, replace the sections below with the issue’s actual content.
