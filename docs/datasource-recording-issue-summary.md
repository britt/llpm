title: "Datasource recording issue summary (DEMO-4)"
---

## Source

- Jira issue: https://sandgarden-dev.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DEMO/boards/34?selectedIssue=DEMO-4

## Summary

The Jira issue content for **DEMO-4** is not accessible from within this documentation update environment, so the issue cannot be summarized here without guessing.

## What was checked

To avoid inventing details, the repository was searched for text that could ground a summary of DEMO-4 (for example, references to the issue key or terms such as “datasource” and “recording”). No matches were found in the source repository for:

- `DEMO-4`
- `datasource`
- `recording`

## Next step

Paste the issue description (or a redacted export) into this page, then replace the placeholder sections above with a real summary grounded in that text.
