# Datasource recording issue summary (DEMO-4)

This page is intended to summarize Jira issue **DEMO-4**:

- https://sandgarden-dev.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/DEMO-4

## Status

The Jira issue content is not accessible from the current documentation update environment, so this page cannot include an accurate summary of the issue.

Populate this page by adding the Jira issue content into the repository (for example, as a quoted block in this page), then replacing the placeholder sections below.

If the issue becomes accessible to this environment, use one of the following artifacts as source material:

- A pasted JSON payload from `GET /rest/api/2/issue/DEMO-4` (sanitized as needed).
- A pasted copy of the issue fields in plain text (summary, description, steps, acceptance criteria).

Once available, replace the sections below with the issue content.

## Summary (to be filled from Jira)

- The user-visible problem being reported.
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior.
- Any constraints called out in the issue (environment, versions, roles).
