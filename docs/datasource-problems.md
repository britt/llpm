title: "Datasource recording rules: problem statements (summary)"
---

This page is intended to summarize the problem statements in **“Product Spec: Datasource Recording Rules”** and provide examples of how each problem can affect users.

## Source material

The source material for this page is a Notion document:

- https://www.notion.so/Product-Spec-Datasource-Recording-Rules-2fff366d7aa08079a5c5e6dad6e8eb65?pvs=13

The content of that Notion page is not available from within this documentation build environment, so the specific problem statements cannot be quoted or summarized here without risking inaccuracies.

## Fill-in template

Add each problem statement from the Notion spec under its own heading, followed by user-impact examples.
