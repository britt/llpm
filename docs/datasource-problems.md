title: "Datasource recording rules: problem statements (summary)"
---

This page summarizes the problem statements in **“Product Spec: Datasource Recording Rules”** and provides examples of how each problem can affect users.

## Source material

The source material for this page is a Notion document:

- https://www.notion.so/Product-Spec-Datasource-Recording-Rules-2fff366d7aa08079a5c5e6dad6e8eb65?pvs=13

The content of that Notion page is not available from within this documentation build environment, so the problem statements cannot be quoted or summarized here without risking inaccuracies.

## How to fill this page

1. Open the Notion spec.
2. Copy each **problem statement** verbatim into this page.
3. Under each statement, add concrete examples of user impact:
   - what the user does
   - what the user sees (symptoms)
   - why the outcome is confusing, incorrect, or hard to debug

## Fill-in template

Add each problem statement from the Notion spec under its own heading, followed by user-impact examples.

### Problem statement: <paste exact text from Notion>

**Why it causes problems**

- <example of a user workflow that breaks or becomes confusing>
- <example of an incorrect/partial recording that results>
- <example of a support/debugging burden this creates>

**Example scenario**

1. <step>
2. <step>
3. <observed user-visible symptom>

**Notes**

- Keep examples specific (realistic UI actions, real inputs, real outputs).
- When unsure about the intended behavior, leave a question inline rather than guessing.
