Thank you for your interest in contributing to LLPM!

## Overview

LLPM welcomes contributions from the community. Whether you are fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## Getting Started

1. **[Development Setup]({{< relref "development-setup" >}})** - Set up your local development environment with Bun and configure API keys
2. **[Testing]({{< relref "testing" >}})** - Learn about our TDD workflow and testing requirements

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices - write tests first
3. Ensure all tests pass with `bun run test`
4. Verify coverage meets thresholds (90%+ lines/functions/statements, 85%+ branches)
5. Run `bun run lint` and `bun run typecheck` to check for errors
6. Submit your pull request with a clear description of changes

See the subsections for detailed guidance on development setup and testing practices.
