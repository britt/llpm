title: Datasource problem statements (needs source)
description: Placeholder page for datasource problem statements pending access to the referenced specification.
toc: true
---

This page is intended to summarize the problem statements from **“Product Spec: Datasource Recording Rules”** and provide examples of how they might cause issues for users.

The referenced source document is not available in the current documentation update environment, so the summary and examples cannot be added without risking incorrect or invented details.

## What is needed to complete this page

- The text of the problem statements from the referenced spec.
- Any defined terms (for example, “datasource”, “recording”, and “rules”) as written in the spec.

## Next step

Paste the problem statements (or export the spec content) into this repository (or provide it via an accessible link) and update this page with:

- A brief bullet list of the problem statements.
- 1–2 concrete user-facing examples per statement.
