# Customer feature requests

This page summarizes which customers are waiting on which features.

## Source of truth

The requested source of truth is a Google Sheet:

- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15aQSU5Qdqqi08-_Yhdv8buK_GgXIeQVHqfa3u-DV7B8/edit?gid=997300960#gid=997300960

That sheet is not available from within this repository, so this page is currently a **template**.

To complete this page, copy the sheet contents into the repository (for example, as `docs/customers.csv`) or paste an export (CSV/Markdown table) into this file, then fill in the sections below.

## Customers → features they are waiting on

| Customer | Features waiting on | Notes / links |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

## Features → customers waiting

| Feature | Customers waiting | Notes / links |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

## Status definitions (optional)

If the sheet includes status/priority fields, define the meanings here so the tables stay consistent.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ |
