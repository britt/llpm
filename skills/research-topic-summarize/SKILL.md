# Research Topic and Summarize Skill

Conduct thorough web research on a topic, synthesize findings into a detailed summary, and capture screenshots of key visuals.

## When to Use

Activate when:
- Evaluating a technology, library, or tool
- Learning about a new concept or pattern
- Comparing options (X vs Y)
- Gathering background for a decision

## Output Structure

```markdown
## Research: [Topic]

### Summary

[Paragraph overview - what it is, why it matters, current state]

### Background

[Context, history, or foundational concepts needed to understand the topic]

### Key Findings

#### [Finding 1 Title]

[Detailed explanation with specifics, numbers, examples]

#### [Finding 2 Title]

[Detailed explanation with evidence from sources]

### Comparisons

| Aspect | Option A | Option B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| [Criteria] | [Detail] | [Detail] |

### Visual References

- ![Description](screenshot-1.png) — [what this shows]
- ![Description](screenshot-2.png) — [what this shows]

### Sources

1. [Title](url) — [what this source contributed]
2. [Title](url) — [what this source contributed]

### Analysis

- **Strengths**: [detailed pros]
- **Weaknesses**: [detailed cons]
- **Gaps**: [what the research didn't answer]

### Recommendation

[Actionable conclusion with reasoning]
```

## Research Guidelines

### Depth of Coverage

- Provide enough detail to make decisions without re-reading sources
- Include specific numbers, versions, dates when relevant
- Explain concepts, don't just name them
- Note conflicting information across sources

### Source Quality

- Prefer official documentation over blog posts
- Note publication dates (flag outdated info)
- Cite sources for all claims
- Include 3-5 quality sources minimum

### Screenshots

Capture screenshots when sources include:
- Architecture or flow diagrams
- Comparison tables
- Pricing or feature matrices
- UI examples (if evaluating tools)
- Code examples that benefit from visual context

### Screenshot Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames: `redis-vs-memcached-comparison.png`
- Always include alt text descriptions
- Capture only relevant portions, not full pages
- Note the source URL in the description
