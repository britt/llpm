# Stakeholder Updates Skill

This skill helps craft effective communications for stakeholders at various levels.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:

- Writing status updates or progress reports
- Communicating delays or blockers
- Sharing launch announcements
- Requesting decisions or resources
- Reporting on milestones or outcomes

## Core Principles

### Know Your Audience

**Executives (C-level):**

- Lead with business impact
- Be concise (3-5 sentences)
- Include metrics and outcomes
- Avoid technical jargon
- Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"

**Management (Directors, VPs):**

- Balance detail with brevity
- Include both progress and blockers
- Provide context for decisions
- Mention resource needs
- Highlight risks and mitigation

**Peers (Other PMs, Team Leads):**

- Can be more detailed
- Include tactical information
- Share lessons learned
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Be transparent about challenges

**Team Members:**

- Provide full context
- Explain "why" behind decisions
- Share timelines and expectations
- Acknowledge contributions
- Be specific about next steps

## Update Structure

### Status Update Template

**Subject/Title:** [Concise summary of current state]

**TL;DR:** (1-2 sentences)
Current status in plain language with key takeaway

**Progress This Week:**

- Completed: [specific accomplishments]
- In Progress: [active work with % complete]
- Planned Next: [upcoming priorities]

**Metrics/Impact:**

- [Quantifiable results or leading indicators]
- [Usage stats, customer feedback, etc.]

**Blockers/Risks:**

- [Issue]: Impact and proposed resolution
- [Risk]: Likelihood, impact, mitigation plan

**Decisions Needed:**

- [Decision 1]: Context, options, recommendation, deadline
- [Decision 2]: ...

**Next Milestones:**

- [Date]: [Milestone and success criteria]

### Example: Executive Update (After Feature Launch)

**Subject:** Payment Flow Redesign - Live with 23% Conversion Lift

**TL;DR:** New checkout launched Tuesday. Conversion up 23%, support tickets down 15%. Monitoring for issues.

**Impact:**

- 23% increase in purchase conversion (baseline: 12% → current: 14.7%)
- 15% reduction in payment-related support tickets
- $47K additional revenue (3 days post-launch)

**What's Next:**
Rolling out to mobile apps next week. Full metrics report Friday.

**FYI:** Minor bug in Safari addressed Wednesday. No customer impact.

### Example: Team Update (Project Delay)

**Subject:** Q2 Mobile Release - Timeline Update

**Context:**
We've hit an integration blocker with the third-party payment SDK that requires vendor support.

**Impact:**

- Original ship date: May 15
- Revised ship date: May 29 (2-week delay)
- Affects: iOS and Android apps
- Does NOT affect: Web release (still May 15)

**What Happened:**
The SDK update (required for PCI compliance) introduced breaking changes to the refund flow. Vendor confirmed this is a known issue and they're releasing a patch.

**Mitigation:**

- Vendor committed to patch by May 22
- QA time reduced by reusing web test scenarios
- Stakeholder communications sent
- Customer impact: None (no existing feature affected)

**What I Need:**

- Your approval to adjust the milestone in Jira
- Communication to sales team (I've drafted a message)

**Lessons:**
Adding "SDK update review" step to our release checklist to catch this earlier next time.

## Communication Best Practices

### Lead with the Punchline

❌ "We've been working on improving the checkout flow and after several iterations and testing..."
✅ "Checkout conversion is up 23% since Tuesday's launch."

### Use the "So What?" Test

Every statement should answer: "Why does this matter?"

❌ "We added a progress indicator"
✅ "We added a progress indicator, reducing checkout abandonment by 12%"

### Be Specific with Numbers

❌ "Most users are happy"
✅ "NPS increased from 42 to 58 (n=247 responses)"

### Own Problems, Share Credit

When things go wrong: "I underestimated the integration complexity"
When things go right: "The engineering team delivered this ahead of schedule"

### Provide Context for Decisions

Don't just state what you decided—explain why:
"We're prioritizing mobile over tablet because 87% of our traffic is mobile, and tablet usage is trending down (15% decrease QoQ)."

### Signal Confidence Levels

- "We will ship May 15" (high confidence, committed)
- "We expect to ship around May 15" (medium confidence, estimate)
- "We're targeting mid-May" (lower confidence, subject to change)

## Special Situations

### Announcing Bad News

1. **State the problem clearly** (no sugarcoating)
2. **Explain the impact** (who is affected, how much)
3. **Own the mistake** (if applicable)
4. **Present the solution** (what you're doing about it)
5. **Set expectations** (timeline for resolution)

Example:
"The feature we shipped yesterday caused a 30% increase in page load time. This affects all users on mobile devices. I approved the release without adequate performance testing—my mistake. We've rolled back the change and users should see normal performance within the hour. We're adding performance benchmarks to our release checklist."

### Requesting Resources

1. **State the need** (what you need)
2. **Explain the why** (business justification)
3. **Show the trade-off** (what happens if you don't get it)
4. **Provide options** (full ask vs. minimum viable)
5. **Make it easy to say yes** (clear next step)

Example:
"I'm requesting 1 additional engineer for Q3 to build the analytics dashboard. Without this, we'll miss the September board meeting commitment, and sales won't have the ROI metrics needed for enterprise deals (estimated $200K+ in lost pipeline). Alternative: we could descope real-time data and ship basic reporting in August, but this limits sales use cases."

### Celebrating Wins

- **Be specific** about what was accomplished
- **Credit the team** by name when possible
- **Tie to strategy** (how does this support larger goals?)
- **Share learnings** (what made this successful?)

Example:
"Sarah and the eng team launched the SSO integration 2 weeks early, unlocking our first enterprise deal ($120K ARR). This validates our hypothesis that enterprise customers will pay 3x more for team features. Next up: audit logging, which is the #2 requested feature from this segment."

## Workflow Tips

1. **Search notes for context** before writing updates
2. **Save templates** for recurring updates (weekly status, launch announcements, etc.)
3. **Draft important messages** and sleep on them before sending
4. **Get feedback** from peers on sensitive communications
5. **Follow up** on action items and decisions requested

## Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ **Burying the lede** - Don't hide important info in paragraph 3
- ❌ **Jargon overload** - Assume your audience doesn't know technical terms
- ❌ **Defensiveness** - Own mistakes without excuses
- ❌ **Vagueness** - "We're working on it" tells them nothing
- ❌ **Over-promising** - Under-promise and over-deliver
- ❌ **No action items** - Every update should have a clear next step
