# Triage New Issues Skill

Review new or untriaged GitHub issues, assess priority based on urgency signals, suggest labels, and recommend owners.

## When to Use

Activate when:
- Processing new incoming issues
- Reviewing untriaged backlog
- Assessing issue priority
- Assigning issues to owners

## Output Structure (per issue)

```markdown
## Triage: #[number] — [title]

### Priority Assessment

**Urgency**: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
**Impact**: [Wide | Moderate | Limited]
**Recommended Priority**: P[0-3]

| Signal | Indicator |
|--------|-----------|
| [Keyword/label found] | [What it suggests] |

### Classification

**Type**: [Bug | Feature | Question | Task]
**Area**: [Component or area affected]
**Suggested Labels**: `priority/high`, `bug`, `area/auth`
**Suggested Assignee**: @username (owns this area)

### Assessment

[Summary of the issue and reasoning for priority assignment]

### Clarifying Questions (if needed)

- [ ] [Question to understand severity]

### Recommendation

[Immediate action | Next sprint | Backlog | Needs info | Duplicate of #X]
```

## Priority Signals

### Critical (P0)
**Keywords**: "down", "outage", "security", "vulnerability", "production", "urgent", "ASAP", "breach"
**Labels**: `critical`, `security`, `production`
**Action**: Immediate attention required

### High (P1)
**Keywords**: "blocking", "regression", "broken", "can't use", "data loss", "crash"
**Labels**: `blocker`, `regression`, `priority/high`
**Action**: Address this sprint

### Medium (P2)
**Keywords**: "bug", "incorrect", "should", "expected", "wrong"
**Labels**: `bug`, `priority/medium`
**Action**: Schedule for upcoming sprint

### Low (P3)
**Keywords**: "nice to have", "minor", "cosmetic", "enhancement", "workaround exists"
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `low-priority`
**Action**: Add to backlog

## Triage Guidelines

### Assessment Process

1. Read title and full description
2. Scan for urgency keywords and labels
3. Check for existing labels that signal priority
4. Assess impact (how many users affected)
5. Look for workarounds mentioned
6. Check if duplicate of existing issue

### When to Escalate

- Security vulnerabilities → Flag immediately
- Production outages → Notify on-call
- Data integrity issues → High priority regardless of other signals

### When to Ask Questions

- Unclear reproduction steps
- Missing environment details
- Ambiguous severity ("it's broken" but unclear impact)
- No indication of urgency or timeline

### Red Flags

- Issues with no response from author (>7 days)
- Duplicate of closed/wontfix issue
- Feature request disguised as bug
- Missing required information from template
