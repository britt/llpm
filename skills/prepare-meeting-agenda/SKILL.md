# Prepare Meeting Agenda Skill

Generate structured meeting agendas by gathering context from recent project activity.

## Workflow

1. **Identify meeting type** - Determine format and focus areas
2. **Gather context** - Search recent issues, PRs, and notes
3. **Group by topic** - Organize items logically
4. **Assign owners** - Note who should speak to each item
5. **Estimate time** - Allocate realistic durations
6. **Output agenda** - Format using template below

## Meeting Types

### Sprint Planning
- Focus: upcoming work, priorities, capacity
- Sources: backlog issues, milestone items
- Include: estimates, assignments, dependencies

### Retrospective
- Focus: what worked, what didn't, improvements
- Sources: completed issues, incident notes, team feedback
- Include: wins to celebrate, problems to address

### Standup/Sync
- Focus: progress, blockers, today's priorities
- Sources: in-progress issues, recent commits
- Include: quick updates, blockers needing help

## Agenda Template

```markdown
## [Meeting Type] - [Date]

**Attendees**: [list or "team"]
**Duration**: [X minutes]

### Topics

| Topic | Owner | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
